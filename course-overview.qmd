title: "PSYC 640: Graduate Statistics"
---

This course is the introduction to statistics for graduate students. The goal of the course is to provide a grounding in statistical concepts, methods and application to research. I aim to increase studentâ€™s confidence in using these techniques and introducing them to R. Topics will range from including mathematical conceptualizations to practical application with various techniques ranging from descriptive statistics to regression.
