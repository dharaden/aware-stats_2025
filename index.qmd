## Workshop Description

A foundation in organizing your R projects and combatting informal practices. Introduction and exploration of Open Science within a Clinical/Community framework.

### Expectations and Goals

The main goal of this course/workshop is to provide an on-ramp to using R in practice. There will likely be introductions to coding and using the software as well as important functions that are used within a social science perspective. Additionally, a goal is to introduce researchers to effective strategies and practices for organizing their research projects within R. The focus will revolve around promoting Open Science practices as they apply to own interests. I will introduce a workflow within R that will maximize reproducibility and attempt to future proof analyses (take that future Dustin!).
