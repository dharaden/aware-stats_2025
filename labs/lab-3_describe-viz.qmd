## Instructions

Can't believe we're at Lab #3! Keep it going! We are going to continue
to practice importing data and making a reproducible workflow. In this
lab, you will be expanding the types of plots you are able to use.

We will be using data from the [Bechdel
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test), a measure of the
representation of women in fiction. You will be asked to do some
Exploratory Data Analysis.

Here are the things that you will need for this lab:

-   <a href="/files/_lab-rmd/lab-3_describe-viz.Rmd" download="lab-3_describe-viz.Rmd">Download
    Lab 3 (.Rmd)</a>
-   <a href="/files/data/bechdel.csv" download="bechdel.csv">Download
    Bechdel Data (.csv)</a>

When you are finished, click the **Knit** button to turn your work into
an HTML document. You will submit both this `.Rmd` file and the
üß∂knitted `.html` file.

## Scenario and Goal

In this lab, you will act as a data journalist exploring a dataset on
movies. We will use the data from the FiveThirtyEight story ‚ÄúThe
Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood‚Äôs Exclusion of Women.‚Äù

This analysis is about the [Bechdel
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test), a measure of the
representation of women in fiction.

Your goal is to **import, describe, and visualize** this data to
understand the characteristics of movies in the dataset and see if there
are relationships between a movie's budget, its box office gross, and
its Bechdel Test rating. This is the critical first step in any
analysis, known as **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

## Variables of Interest

-   `year`: The year of movie release

-   `clean_test`: Bechdel test result:

    -   `ok` = passes test

    -   `dubious`

    -   `men` = women only talk about men

    -   `notalk` = women don‚Äôt talk to each other

    -   `nowomen` = fewer than two women

<!-- -->

-   `binary`: Bechdel Test PASS vs FAIL binary

-   `budget_2013`: Total movie budget

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Importing and Inspecting

First, you need to set up your RMarkdown to get it ready for importing
the data and using the appropriate libraries. Be sure to have all
libraries listed here in the first code chunk along with importing the
data. I should not see any lines that say `install.packages()`.

I will attempt to reproduce your output in my own computer, so be sure
that your code is reproducible.

**Question 1:** Look at the output from your overview. How many total
movies are in this database? And what year is the latest movie?

**Your Answer:**

**Question 2:** Calculate the Average budget of the whole dataset. Then,
calculate the average for only movies in the year 2000.

**Your Answer:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 2: Grouped Descriptive Statistics

Averages for the whole dataset are useful, but we are often more
interested in comparing averages *between groups*. Let's see if the
average budget differs for movies that pass the Bechdel Test versus
those that fail. The `binary` variable tells us this ("PASS" or "FAIL").

**Question 3:** Based on your summary table, do movies that pass or fail
the Bechdel test have a higher average (mean) budget?

**Your Answer:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 3: Visualizing a Distribution (Histogram)

Let's visualize the distribution of domestic gross earnings (adjusted
for 2013) across all the movies.

**Question 4:** Describe the shape of the distribution you see in the
histogram. Is it symmetric (like a bell curve), or is it skewed in one
direction? Where do most movies' earnings seem to be clustered?

**Your Answer:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 4: Examining the Bechdel Test distribution

Now we want to see how many movies fall into each of the Bechdel
categories. Generate a barplot of the `clean_test` variable to see what
the distribution of the test is.

Then choose a year in the dataset, create a similar plot (but only for
that year). Therefore you should have 2 plots below:

**Question 5:** Examine both charts and describe the similarities and
differences that you are noticing.

**Answer:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Exercise 5: Comparing Groups with a Boxplot

Now let's visually compare the inflation-adjusted international gross
(`intgross_2013`) for movies that pass the Bechdel test versus those
that fail. A boxplot is an excellent way to see differences in the
median and spread between groups.

**Question 6:** Look at the boxplot. The thick horizontal line in the
middle of each box represents the median. Does there appear to be a
large difference in the median domestic gross between movies that pass
and fail the test?

**Your Answer:**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*End of Lab 3. You've now practiced exploratory data analysis! It is
always important to visualize your data to get a good sense of what you
are working with. Don't forget to Knit! üß∂*
