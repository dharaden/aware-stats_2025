# Using the Power of R-Markdown

![](images/clipboard-861228540.png)

We are going to explore some of the useful libraries to report tables in R, and try to capitalize on how R knits information. The goal is to have all analyses and the text in a single document that will update as necessary.

There won't be any slides with this one, we will just work on doing some coding together!
