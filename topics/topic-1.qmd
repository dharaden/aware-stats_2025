# R & Tidy Data

Welcome to the workshop (I hope this isn't the first time I am welcoming you)! I am very excited to get to work with you throughout this workshop. We will begin with a brief exploration into using R & R-Studio, and an overall emphasis on reproducible workflows. This first portion will set up

Weâ€™ll then dive right into our primary tool, R. This session will go over installing R and RStudio, navigating the interface, understanding R projects, and learning the foundational syntax of the R language and the `tidyverse`, including data types and basic functions.
