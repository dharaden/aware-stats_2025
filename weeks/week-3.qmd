# Descriptives, Visualizations + Communication

We are now in the third week and you are all probably thinking about how much you dislike R and do not ever want to look at the `here()` library again. But we are going to have to do just that. Importing and getting started are one of the hardest things to do when first working with R. And then trying to make things reproducible is another thing. We are going to practice this A LOT. Especially right in the beginning.

This week we are going to expand on some data wrangling to get more comfortable with `dplyr` and the larger `tidyverse`. [Here is a good website that can also be helpful](https://p4a.jhelvy.com/data-wrangling). Then we will move into an overview of descriptive statistics and how to get them using R. Finally, we will continue with visualizations using `ggplot2`. With time, we will start introducing how to talk communicate these types of statistics in a manuscript.
