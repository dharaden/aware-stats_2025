# Welcome Back!

## Updates/Check-in {.smaller}

-   [Upcoming Schedule](https://dharaden.github.io/psyc641-s25/)

-   [Final Project](https://dharaden.github.io/psyc641-s25/project/final-proj-desc.html):

    ::: nonincremental
    -   Up Next - Methods/Procedures draft
        -   Let's Talk about it
    :::

## Computational setup (don't think we'll need)

```{r packages}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

# load packages
library(tidyverse)   # for data wrangling and visualization
library(scales)      # for pretty axis labels
library(knitr)       # for pretty tables
library(patchwork)   # for laying out plots

# set default theme and larger font size for ggplot2
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_minimal(base_size = 20))
```

# Experimental Designs

-   Identified as the "Gold Standard" within research. Why is it considered the "gold standard"??

-   The ability to draw *causal* connections between variables

    -   e.g., Diffusion of Responsibility (Darley & Latane, 1968)

# Stress Experiment

On a scale of 1 (low levels) - 10 (high levels), take note of your current level of stress

## Stress Experiment Follow-up

On a scale of 1 (low levels) - 10 (high levels), take note of your current level of stress

-   Did these cute animal pictures *cause* you to be more/less stressed?

# Causation

How can we determine causation? i.e., one variable **causes** another to change

## Shadish, Cook & Campbell (2002)

Drawing from John Stuart Mill’s philosophy

Three Criteria for Causal Relationships:

1.  **Temporal precedence** (cause precedes effect)

2.  **Covariation** (cause and effect are correlated)

3.  **Elimination of plausible alternative explanations** (ruling out confounding variables)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Counterfactual Reasoning

-   Hypothetical situation where manipulated outcomes are compared to the outcomes without a manipulation (i.e., time travel)

-   How does this work?

    -   Group of individuals get a treatment

    -   We measure their outcomes

    -   We rewind time and do not give the group the treatment

    -   We measure these outcomes

    -   Compare!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Design

Random Assignment –\> IV –\> DV

Simple!

-   What if we can't randomly assign? What are things that we can't randomly assign?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Quasi-experimental Design**]{.underline}

-   But that is next week. Stay on track and don't get distracted

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Random Assignment

Every participant has an equal likelihood of being in each of the groups

-   Coin Flip

-   Computer Algorithm

Will need to check for group differences on variables of interest and other meaningful characteristics.

-   What statistical test would we use?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Randomized Control Trial (RCT)

-   We have a random sample ✅

-   We have random assignment ✅

-   But what are the groups that we are assigning?

    -   What is the research question, and what do we want to compare it against?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### RCT

The comparison/control group means a lot when it comes to the conclusions that we can establish

-   Treatment vs. ...

    -   Waitlist Control?

    -   Treatment as usual?

    -   Other treatment?

    -   Placebo?

    -   Nothing?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Placebo Effect

This has been an emerging area of research that is utterly fascinating

On occasion, the placebo shows just as much of an effect as the actual treatment

Example: Treating Depression ([link](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4172306/#:~:text=To%20summarize%2C%20there%20is%20a,but%20the%20placebo%20effect%20is.))

# Example

Investigate the bidirectional relationships between sleep patterns, social media use, and depressive symptoms in adolescents over a two-year period.

-    **Measures:**

    -   Sleep: Actigraphy (1 week per assessment) + Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index

    -   Social Media: Screen time logs + Social Media Addiction Scale

    -   Depression: Beck Depression Inventory

    -   Covariates: Pubertal status, SES, parental depression

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Draw it on the board

-   What stats can we do?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Next Class...

We will have a class activity where you will evaluate studies and provide additional input

Please review the following studies:

-   Bobo Doll Experiment

-   Zimbardo Prison Study

-   Milgram Obedience Study

-   ["Monster" Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Study)

    Mundane Realism vs. Psychological Realism
