## Class Materials

I've pulled from a lot of different textbooks. Good thing is, they are all free!

# Warm-up

-   2-minute think-pair-share: interpret this figure/table snippet.

# Concepts (brief)

-   Keep math minimal; emphasize assumptions, use-cases, effect sizes.

# Live demo (R)

```{r}
# setup
library(rio)
library(here)
#dat <- import(here::here("data","sample.csv"))
```

# Guided practice

-   Students follow along: 3–5 tasks with immediate feedback.

# Interpretation

-   Translate model output to 2–3 sentences as in a results section.

# Exit ticket

-   One key takeaway, one question.

# Next

-   Prep and due items for next week.
