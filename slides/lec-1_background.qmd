# Replication & Reproducibility

**Replication:** The process of applying the same methodology with a different sample and research group

**Reproduction:** Taking all materials from a study and coming to the same conclusions

## Replication & Reproducibility 🍰

I want to bake a cake!

::: incremental
1.  Find a recipe online (try ignoring their life story narrative)
2.  Get ingredients (Wegmans if you 💰)
3.  Follow recipe and bake 🧑‍🍳
4.  Enjoy the delicious cake 🍽️

## Replication & Reproducibility 🍰

I want to bake a cake!

**Reproduction**

::: incremental
1.  Find a recipe online –\> **Find their kitchen**
2.  Get ingredients –\> **Use their ingredients**
3.  Follow recipe and bake –\> **Watch what they do and follow**
4.  Enjoy the delicious cake –\> **Enjoy cake (and jail for B&E)**

## Replication & Reproducibility 📊

<br></br>

| Replication | Reproducibility |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Have a similar research question | Use the same research question |
| Collect your own data | Use their data |
| Follow their steps with **your** resources | Follow their steps with **their** resources |
| Outcome: Similar results (depends on other factors) | Outcome: Identical results |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Replication & Reproducibility 📊

[Goals of Science]{.underline}

**Important:** We want to ***replicate*** other researchers work

**MOST Important:** Be able to ***reproduce*** all of our results

You are your own worst collaborator!

## Installing and Using R

[From the course website](../resources.html)

[Modern Statistics Using R](https://www.modernstatisticswithr.com/thebasics.html){target="_blank"}

# Break Time ☕

Or at least I hope it is around this time

# Now back to the show!

## Working with R-Studio

R-Studio is just like a kitchen 🧑‍🍳

The Environment pane is the pantry/fridge

The Console is like the oven/stove

The Markdown document is the recipe

The bottom right sometimes acts as the little window on the oven where you can see things baking

Creating a Project puts these things in their place

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps

-   Create a project

-   Set up a Markdown Document

-   Run and Knit the document

-   Live Example

# In Class Workshop

Create a new .Rmd file and name it `introduction.Rmd`

In the markdown, delete everything that is unnecessary

Introduce yourself in the text portion of the document

Load `tidyverse` and use the `starwars` dataset
