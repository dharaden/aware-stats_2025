# Replication & Reproducibility

**Replication:** The process of applying the same methodology with a different sample and research group

**Reproduction:** Taking all materials from a study and coming to the same conclusions

## Replication & Reproducibility 🍰

I want to bake a cake!

1.  Find a recipe online (try ignoring their life story narrative)
2.  Get ingredients (Wegmans if you 💰)
3.  Follow recipe and bake
4.  Enjoy the delicious cake
