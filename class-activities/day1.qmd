### **In-Class Activity: Your First R Session**

**Goal**: To become familiar with the RStudio interface and perform a basic data exploration workflow.

### Create a new Markdown Document

1.  Go to `File > New File > R Markdown`

2.  Provide the title "Day 1" and input your name as the author

3.  A script will open in the **Source** pane. Remove unnecessary code.

4.  Go to `File > Save` and name it `introduction.Rmd`. Make sure this saves in the same folder as all of your other stuff. Stay Organized!

    1.  I'm not going to tell you how to organize your folders, but I will give a suggestion. Have 1 folder for the whole class. This will have the Project that we created. Inside there, have a folder for "Class Activities". This is where you can save this file. Then, have other folders for the labs and what not.

### Starting the document

In the text field of the markdown file, introduce yourself! Answer these questions below:

> -   Name:
>
> -   Pronouns
>
> -   Year in school
>
> -   College Major
>
> -   Comfort with R (1-10 with 10 being "Expert")
>
> -   Overall feelings toward Statistics
>
> -   Anything else you want to share

### **Your First "Analysis"**

1.  Create a Code Chunk

2.  Load the `tidyverse` library

3.  Create the object `datawars` and assign dataset called `starwars` to it (hint: `data <- cars`)

4.  Use `View()`, `head()` and `glimpse()` to look at `datawars`

5.  In the text below, answer these questions:

    1.  What do each of these do?

    2.  Which do you like more?

6.  Create another code chunk and use `summary()` to get descriptives of all variables in the dataset.

    1.  Look at the output of your `summary()` command. For the `mass` and `height` variables, you'll see a value for `NA's`. In your own words, what do you think `NA` means in this context?

#### Visualize your data

Now we want to investigate the relationship between `mass` and `height` in this dataset.

-   Create a scatterplot using `ggplot()`.

-   The plot should show `height` on the x-axis and `mass` on the y-axis.

-   Add some labels to make your plot clear and professional.

    -   **Hint:** Use the code below as a template and fill in the blanks.

``` r
ggplot(data = __, aes(x = __, y = __)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "__",
       x = "__",
       y = "__")
```

-   Look at your plot. Do you notice any characters that seem unusually heavy for their height? Briefly describe one.

#### Wrangle your Data

Since we have some outliers that seem to be related to non-human species, let's just look at Humans.

1.  Create a new object called `rebels`.

2.  This new object should contain only the characters from the `starwars` dataset where the `species` is "Human".

    -   **Hint:** Use the `filter()` function. The syntax is `new_object <- old_object %>% filter(column_name == "value")`. Remember that "Human" needs to be in quotes.

3.  Print your new `rebels` object to the console to make sure your filter worked correctly. Once confirmed, calculate the average (hint: use `mean()`) for the height and weight of the `rebels`.

-   How many rows are in your new `rebels` dataset?

-   What is the average height and weight?

4.  Create another scatterplot with your new dataset. Copy and update the code we used previously.

### Closing out the Document

What is 1 thing you are looking forward to this semester and 1 thing that you are worried about (can be in or outside of this class)?
