Due to the accelerated nature of the course, the late penalty will be more severe. There will be a 50% deduction on the first day. Work will not be accepted beyond 24 hours after the deadline.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing academic adjustments to students with disabilities. If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I¬†have a mandatory reporting responsibility¬†as a part of¬†my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to¬†report information I¬†receive¬†regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT.¬†\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT‚Äôs policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT‚Äôs Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT‚Äôs confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. RIT‚Äôs policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nEach course that you are involved in will have differing opinions and goals regarding generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). In this course you are allowed to use these as a tool. You can use prompts such as ‚ÄúTeach me about (insert psych topic here) and give me an example that might apply to me.‚Äù If you do use generative AI, I would like for you to disclose that information just so I can have a sense of how it is being used. If I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course. However, as instructor, I reserve the right to modify this document during the semester, if necessary, to ensure that we achieve course learning objectives. You will receive advance notice of any changes to the syllabus through myCourses/email."

This portion of your grade is earned by being present and engaged. This includes participating in group discussions, engaging with the readings, working with peers on problems, and completing the small, hands-on coding exercises we‚Äôll do together or in small groups in class. This is a low-stress grade based on your consistent effort and collaboration during our classes.\nMidterm Project\n¬†This is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset I will provide. You will be asked to clean and visualize the data, formulate a research question, build an appropriate regression model, check its assumptions, and write a concise report of your findings. This project assesses your mastery of the first half of the course.\nFinal Project\nFor your final project, you will choose a dataset (either your own research data or from a list of options), develop your own research questions, and conduct a full analysis from start to finish. You will present your work in a short, manuscript-style report and a brief ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù to the class in our final meeting.

We‚Äôll cover the course philosophy, getting R/RStudio running, and the core logic of the tidyverse. The main skill will be learning to wrangle data with dplyr verbs (select, filter, mutate, arrange).\n\nWeek 2 (Sep.¬†1) ‚Äî LABOR DAY (NO CLASS)\n\nContinue to develop skills and comfort in R. You will be provided with readings and other practice problems, and maybe a video lecture.\n\nWeek 3 (Sep.¬†8) ‚Äî Describing, Visualizing & Communicating\n\nTopics: Now that we can handle data, what‚Äôs in it? We‚Äôll cover descriptive statistics (central tendency, variability) and focus heavily on creating powerful, publication-quality visualizations with ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\nPart II: Building the Model from the Ground Up\n\nWeek 4 (Sep.¬†15) ‚Äî Modeling Relationships with Correlation\n\nTopics: How do variables relate? We‚Äôll discuss covariance and correlation as a way to quantify the direction and strength of a linear relationship.\n\nWeek 5 (Sep.¬†22) ‚Äî The Model is a Line: Simple Linear Regression\n\nTopics: We officially introduce the simple regression model: Yi‚Äã=Œ≤0‚Äã+Œ≤1‚ÄãXi‚Äã+œµi‚Äã. We‚Äôll cover parameter estimation (slope, intercept), using the lm() function, and interpreting model fit (R2).\n\nWeek 6 (Sep.¬†29) ‚Äî Inference for the Model\n\nTopics: How confident are we in our slope? We‚Äôll cover standard errors, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing for regression coefficients (t-tests) and the overall model (F-test).\n\nWeek 7 (Oct.¬†6) ‚Äî Adding Predictors: Multiple Regression\n\nTopics: Most outcomes have more than one cause. We‚Äôll expand our model to include multiple predictors, focusing on interpreting partial slopes and understanding adjusted R2.\n\nWeek 8 (Oct.¬†13) ‚Äî FALL BREAK (NO CLASS) Enjoy the break!\n\n\n\nPart III: Expanding the Model‚Äôs Power\n\nWeek 9 (Oct.¬†20) ‚Äî Adding Groups: Categorical Predictors\n\nTopics: How do we model experimental groups? We‚Äôll cover dummy coding to include categorical variables. This is where we have the ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moment, demonstrating how t-tests and ANOVA are just special cases of the regression model they already know.\n\nWeek 10 (Oct.¬†27) ‚Äî When Variables Collide: Interactions\n\nTopics: Exploring moderation. We will add interaction terms to the model to ask questions like, ‚ÄúDoes the effect of X on Y depend on the level of Z?‚Äù We‚Äôll focus on plotting and probing interactions to understand them.\n\nWeek 11 (Nov.¬†3) ‚Äî Is My Model Okay? Assumptions & Diagnostics\n\nTopics: A critical look at our models. We‚Äôll cover the core OLS assumptions (linearity, normality, etc.), how to test them visually in R, and what to do when they are violated.\n\nWeek 12 (Nov.¬†10) ‚Äî Midterm Project Workshop\n\nTopics: No new material. This is a dedicated session for students to work on their midterm projects with direct support from you and their peers.\n\n\n\n\nPart IV: Advanced Topics & Application\n\nWeek 13 (Nov.¬†17) ‚Äî Power, Effect Size & Planning Research\n\nTopics: Moving beyond the p-value. We‚Äôll discuss how to quantify the magnitude of an effect and conduct a priori power analyses to design better studies.\n\nWeek 14 (Nov.¬†24) ‚Äî Building & Comparing Models\n\nTopics: How do we choose the ‚Äúbest‚Äù model? We‚Äôll cover strategies for model building (hierarchical, stepwise) and techniques for comparing non-nested models (AIC, BIC).\n\nWeek 15 (Dec.¬†1) ‚Äî Expanding the Framework: Logistic Regression\n\nTopics: What if the outcome is binary (yes/no)? We‚Äôll introduce the Generalized Linear Model via logistic regression, focusing on interpreting log-odds and odds ratios.\n\nWeek 16 (Dec.¬†8) ‚Äî Final Presentations & Wrap Up\n\nTopics: Students give ‚Äúlightning talks‚Äù on their final project results. We‚Äôll review the journey from plotting points to building sophisticated models and celebrate their progress.",
