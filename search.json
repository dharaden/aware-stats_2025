Due to the accelerated nature of the course, the late penalty will be more severe. There will be a 50% deduction on the first day. Work will not be accepted beyond 24 hours after the deadline.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing academic adjustments to students with disabilities. If you would like to request academic adjustments such as testing modifications due to a disability, please contact the Disability Services Office. Contact information for the DSO and information about how to request adjustments can be found at www.rit.edu/dso. After you receive academic adjustment approval, it is imperative that you contact me as early as possible so that we can work out whatever arrangement is necessary.\n\n\n\nAs an instructor, I¬†have a mandatory reporting responsibility¬†as a part of¬†my role. It is my goal that you feel comfortable sharing information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep the information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, I am required to¬†report information I¬†receive¬†regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred during your time at RIT.¬†\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT‚Äôs policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender-based discrimination and harassment with RIT‚Äôs Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.\nIf an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.\nIf you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline. If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT‚Äôs confidential resources (listed below).\n\nRIT Counseling and Psychological Services\n\n585-475-2261 (V)\n585-475-6897 (TTY)\nwww.rit.edu/counseling\n\nNTID Counseling and Academic Advising\n\n585-475-6400\nwww.ntid.rit.edu/counselingdept\n\nRIT Student Health Center\n\n585-475-2255 (V)\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/studenthealth\n\nCenter for Religious Life\n\n585-475-2137\nwww.rit.edu/studentaffairs/religion\n\nRIT Ombuds Office\n\n585-475-7357\n585-475-6424\n585-286-4677 (VP)\nwww.rit.edu/ombuds/contact-us\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an institution of higher learning, RIT expects students to behave honestly and ethically at all times, especially when submitting work for evaluation in conjunction with any course or degree requirement. The Department of Psychology encourages all students to become familiar with the RIT Honor Code and with RIT‚Äôs Academic Integrity Policy. RIT‚Äôs policy on academic integrity requires the instructor to investigate of any suspected breach of academic integrity. If the preponderance of evidence indicates a breach of academic integrity, the student who did so may incur a consequence up to and including failure for the entire course.\nAbout Generative AI\nEach course that you are involved in will have differing opinions and goals regarding generative AI (i.e., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, etc.). In this course you are allowed to use these as a tool. You can use prompts such as ‚ÄúTeach me about (insert psych topic here) and give me an example that might apply to me.‚Äù If you do use generative AI, I would like for you to disclose that information just so I can have a sense of how it is being used. If I suspect that the work that you have turned in is using AI, we will have to have a conversation to determine the next steps. Turning in AI work is considered plagiarism, and you may be asked to re-do the assignment, or possibly receive a 0 on the assignment.\n\n\n\nRIT is committed to the safety of the RIT community and beyond. Because the situation is still in a rapid state of change, checking the RIT Ready website, and specifically the RIT Safety Plan for the most up to date information is recommended: https://www.rit.edu/ready/rit-safety-plan.\n\n\n\nI have provided this syllabus as a guide to our course and have made every attempt to provide an accurate overview of the course. However, as instructor, I reserve the right to modify this document during the semester, if necessary, to ensure that we achieve course learning objectives. You will receive advance notice of any changes to the syllabus through myCourses/email."
