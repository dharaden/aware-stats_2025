This happened randomly across the sample.\nImplication: No systematic bias, but listwise deletion reduces power.\n\n\nMAR (Missing at Random)\nStudents with higher stress were more likely to skip the sleep tracking part of the study because they felt overwhelmed. As a result, sleep data is more likely to be missing for students with high stress.\nImplication: Bias is introduced unless the stress variable is used during imputation.\n\n\nMNAR (Missing Not at Random)\nStudents who were failing classes were more likely to avoid reporting GPA due to embarrassment or fear of consequences. Thus, missingness in GPA is directly related to GPA itself.\nImplication: Hardest case—there’s no observed variable to “explain” the missingness, and imputations are highly assumption-dependent."

    "text": "The “Monster” Study (1939)\n\nOverview\nThe Monster Study (1939) was a controversial experiment conducted by University of Iowa researchers Wendell Johnson and his graduate student Mary Tudor. It aimed to test Johnson’s diagnosogenic theory—the idea that labeling normal speech disfluencies as stuttering could induce the disorder. The study involved 22 orphaned children from the Iowa Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home and raised significant ethical concerns due to its harmful methods.\n\n\nMethodology\n\nParticipants: 22 orphans (ages 5–15) divided into four groups: - Group IA: 5 stuttering children given positive feedback (“Your speech is fine”)\n\nGroup IB: 5 stuttering children given no feedback\nGroup IIA: 6 fluent children falsely labeled as stutterers and criticized\nGroup IIB: 6 fluent children given no feedback\n\nIntervention:\n\nTudor visited the orphanage biweekly for 4 months, delivering scripted feedback\nTo falsely labeled children (IIA):\n\n“You have many of the symptoms of a child who is beginning to stutter. You must try to stop yourself immediately… Don’t ever speak unless you can do it right.”\n\nStaff instructions: Monitor speech constantly and correct perceived errors.\n\n\n\n\nEthical Violations\n\nLack of Informed Consent:\n\nOrphans, as minors, could not consent. Staff and guardians were also misled about the study’s purpose\n\nPsychological Harm:\n\nChildren in Group IIA developed anxiety, reduced speech output, and self-consciousness. Some exhibited lasting trauma.\nOne participant later described feeling “damaged for life”.\n\nExploitation of Vulnerable Populations\n\nOrphans were chosen due to their institutionalized status, limiting advocacy or recourse.\n\nDeception:\n\nResearchers concealed the study’s true purpose and manipulated children’s self-perception\n\n\n\n\nResults and Aftermath\n\nShort-Term Effects:\n\nGroup IIA children showed increased disfluencies, shorter responses, and reluctance to speak\nTudor later attempted “positive therapy” to reverse damage after orphanage staff reported worsening speech.\n\nLong-Term Consequences:\n\nMultiple participants developed lifelong speech anxiety and social withdrawal.\nIn 2001, a lawsuit awarded $925,000 to seven survivors for psychological harm.\n\nScientific Impact\n\nThe study was never published due to ethical concerns but later resurfaced in 2001 investigations.\nCritics argue its methodology (small sample, subjective labeling) weakened its validity."

    "text": "The Bobo Doll Experiment (1961)\nThe Bobo Doll Experiment, conducted by Albert Bandura in 1961, was a pioneering study in social learning theory. It demonstrated that children can learn and imitate behaviors simply by observing others, challenging the behaviorist view that learning requires direct reinforcement. However, the study also raised significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding the exposure of children to aggressive behavior.\n\nMethodology\n\nParticipants: 72 children (36 boys and 36 girls) aged 3-6 years from Stanford University Nursery School.\nGroups: Children were divided into three groups:\n\nAggressive Model Group: Observed an adult physically and verbally attacking a Bobo doll (e.g., hitting it with a mallet, shouting “Sock him in the nose!”).\nNon-Aggressive Model Group: Observed an adult playing calmly with toys and ignoring the Bobo doll.\nControl Group: No exposure to any model.\n\nProcedure:\n\nEach child individually observed their assigned model for 10 minutes.\nAfterward, all children were subjected to a mild frustration task (e.g., being told they couldn’t play with certain toys).\nFinally, they were placed in a room with toys, including a Bobo doll, and observed for imitative aggressive behaviors (e.g., hitting or shouting at the doll).\n\n\n\n\nResults\n\nChildren exposed to the aggressive model were significantly more likely to imitate both physical and verbal aggression compared to the other two groups.\nBoys exhibited more physical aggression than girls, though verbal aggression rates were similar across genders.\nChildren not only imitated specific aggressive actions but also created novel forms of aggression, demonstrating the power of observational learning."
