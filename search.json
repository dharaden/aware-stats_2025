    "text": "The goal of the final project for PSYC 641 is to develop a research proposal similar to what you might see as a pre-registration. You will be placed into groups, which will be your ‚Äúresearch lab group‚Äù. Your group will be tasked with developing a study to answer a central question (e.g., How does mood impact sleep in youth?). As a group, you will develop the Research Deign of a single study to accomplish the main research question. Your individual portion will then consist of using a subset of the data from the study to answer an even more specific question (e.g., What role does positive affect play in the relationship between stress and sleep?).\nThe best way to think about this is you and your team have been given a small grant to study a main focus. Since resources are limited, we want to collect as much data as reasonably possible to address as many different questions as possible. This project will mimic a real-world lab collaboration effort.\n\n\n\nGoal: To create a proposal for the final project.\nOverview: You and your group will define a broad theory/aim/research question. From there, each group member will identify a specific focus. Think of this as starting one set of data collection that will have a central focus, but each of you will have a specific component. It may make sense to think about the data collection technique (e.g., cross-sectional, longitudinal, experimental, etc.) as a group and then identify the component that you will focus on.\nThe goal of this assignment is to clearly identify the overarching theory of your group as well as the specific research question or aim that you seek to accomplish for your portion of the project.\nWork with your group members to identify a central theory or question that you are interested in examining. This can be an extension of a current research project, or something that is new and novel. You can build upon the theory that was started at the beginning of your group, but you don‚Äôt have to.\nStructure: 2+ pages double spaced. Calibri, Arial or Times New Roman font. 1-inch margins. Minimum of 3 citations. Begin with a brief introduction to the topic and identify the broad theory of your group. This will then lead into the rationale for your specific portion. Highlight the importance of your research question and be sure to have this stated clearly. It can be helpful to have these identified as ‚ÄúAims‚Äù of the project.\nThis specific assignment is not set to be a complete evaluation of how you create a study. Instead, I want you to be able to communicate your thought process in a structured way resulting in a single focus or aim.",
